# DATA ARCHITECTURE
The data architecture for this project follows Medallion architecture: Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers
1. Bronze layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into a PostgreSQL Server database
2. Silver layer: This layer includes data cleaning, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.


# PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project involves:
1. Data Architecture: Designing a modern data warehouse using medallion architecture, bronze, silver, and gold layers.
2. ETL pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from the  source system into the warehouse.
3. Data modeling: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. Analytical & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.
# Project requirements
